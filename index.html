      <h2>"Jethro"</h2>
      <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
      
      <p><img src="images/gurtyo.jpg" id="pic1">I am a person of many interests, and <span class="underline">sometimes I find myself too interested in too many things</span>. However, there are still parts of my life that I feel like I can really focus and hone in on. One of those things are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming" target="_blank">programming</a> or coding. Coding to me, is a way of challenging myself and my mind. I like challenging myself with these tricky subjects, but sometimes I enjoy a good time, like in video games. Video games allow me to turn off my brain for a bit and just chill out, but I always end up playing strategy games, so it’s back to thinking.</p>

      <h3>What I am doing now</h3>
      <p><img src="images/gurt.png" id="pic2">I’m currently in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school" target="_blank">high school</a>, trying to get by a flawed system - to me, at least. <span class="underline">I really dislike a lot of people around me</span> and those I see online. It’s frustrating to see all these people have these strange habits and beliefs, some can’t be helped, but for those who stick by these horrid things, it seems rather unbelievable. I almost feel like I look for impurities and imperfections in everyone and everything, but I don’t want to be that way. I want to focus on learning and the positive side of life and to strive to work towards something better than what I’ve got going on now. So many things, happening all at once.</p>
      <h3>Plans for my Future</h3>
      <p><img src="images/yogurt.jpg" id="pic3">To be honest, I really have no idea what I’m doing. I have no clue if I want to go to collage, or move to another country, or just gamble my life away. My dream profession is to fly planes, commercially, privately, or even for cargo. I really want to pursue this career, but as a learn more and more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_pilot" target="_blank">pilots</a> and how they typically live their lives, its usually really hard for them to spend time with their loved ones or their friends, something I value a lot. I struggle to decide what I want to do in my immediate future, and what to do for the rest of my life. Having all these absurdly important decisions made in so short time is...really tough, especially for a high school student.</p>
